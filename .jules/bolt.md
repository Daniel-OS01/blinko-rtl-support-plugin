## 2024-04-14 - Optimize MutationObserver Configuration Calculations
**Learning:** Computing configurations (like array filtering and `document.querySelector` testing) inside a `MutationObserver` callback is an anti-pattern that causes massive performance bottlenecks during frequent DOM updates.
**Action:** Cache static or configuration-dependent values outside of the `MutationObserver` callback (e.g., in `setupObserver`) to significantly improve rendering performance.
## 2024-05-18 - Optimize Selector Validation with dummyElement matches
**Learning:** Validating selectors using `document.querySelector(s)` is extremely slow because it traverses the live document DOM, whereas `document.createElement('div').matches(s)` achieves the same syntax validation ~25x faster by skipping the DOM entirely.
**Action:** Always prefer a dummy element's `.matches()` for validating CSS selectors, and cache the validation results in a Map or Set to completely eliminate repeated validation overhead during configuration setups like `setupObserver()`.

## 2026-04-29 - Optimize Selector Matching
**Learning:** Repeated JS-to-C++ boundary crossings in `Array.prototype.some()` loops with `element.matches()` are significant performance bottlenecks.
**Action:** Pre-combine CSS selectors into a single comma-separated string during config load to evaluate in a single O(1) `element.matches()` call.
