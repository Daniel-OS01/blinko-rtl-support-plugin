## 2024-04-14 - Optimize MutationObserver Configuration Calculations
**Learning:** Computing configurations (like array filtering and `document.querySelector` testing) inside a `MutationObserver` callback is an anti-pattern that causes massive performance bottlenecks during frequent DOM updates.
**Action:** Cache static or configuration-dependent values outside of the `MutationObserver` callback (e.g., in `setupObserver`) to significantly improve rendering performance.
## 2024-05-18 - Optimize Selector Validation with dummyElement matches
**Learning:** Validating selectors using `document.querySelector(s)` is extremely slow because it traverses the live document DOM, whereas `document.createElement('div').matches(s)` achieves the same syntax validation ~25x faster by skipping the DOM entirely.
**Action:** Always prefer a dummy element's `.matches()` for validating CSS selectors, and cache the validation results in a Map or Set to completely eliminate repeated validation overhead during configuration setups like `setupObserver()`.
## 2026-05-08 - Optimize RTL Detection Hot Paths
**Learning:** In high-frequency text processing, bypass object creation overhead (`substring()`, `RegExp.test()`, array `.some()`) by using direct `charCodeAt()` integer evaluations and manual boundary checks to drastically improve execution speed.
**Action:** Use `charCodeAt()` with standard `for` loops and early bounds checking for hot-path string analysis.
